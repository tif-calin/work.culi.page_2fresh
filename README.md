# deno.work.culi.page
This is a remake of a shoddy portfolio site I initially made as a CRA in vanilla JS. It will be deployed at [work.culi.page](https://work.culi.page). You can see an archive of the previous app at

This project is my first time heavily using:
- Fresh
- Tailwind
- Deno Deploy

I have extensive previous experience with these relevant technologies:

## Usage

Start the project:

```bash

Update Fresh with:
```bash
deno run -Ar https://fresh.deno.dev/update
